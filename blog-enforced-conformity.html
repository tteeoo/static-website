<p>by Theo Henson â€” 2022-04-07</p>

<h3 id="Short%20Anecdote%20Written%20While%20Driving%20Through%20Pennsylvania">Short Anecdote Written While Driving Through Pennsylvania</h3>

<pre><code>Towns of mills and mines,
Sleepy cities dot the rolling, wooded hills;
They lose their race with time.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="Resistance">Resistance</h3>

<pre><code>Flee to the countryside with me
And join the Maquis fight
Lead their fascist eyes to see
Enforced conformity&#39;s not right
Refuse submission nor heil Vichy
And open arms to freedom&#39;s sight
</code></pre>

<h3 id="Myth%20No%20Longer%20(Another%20Sequence%20of%20Diminishing,%20Rhyming%20Couplets)">Myth No Longer (Another Sequence of Diminishing, Rhyming Couplets)</h3>

<pre><code>At least you&#39;re cognizant of your senior moments:
A forgotten tooth plucked from youngster&#39;s throat-bits,
Still under the pillow; now fairy&#39;s gone.
A lullaby sung won&#39;t right what&#39;s done.
And think how sad must be the child:
In ways anything but mild,
Has been sullied without
Not mercy nor doubt;
The hope annoyed 
And purloined
By a
Fang.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="Technology%20is%20a%20War%20Against%20Time">Technology is a War Against Time</h3>

<pre><code>Galvanic cell electrifies
Volcanic Hell erupts
Manchuria attacked by Japan
Deliria abstracted by your hand
Crazy, say I
Lazy, says you
Make more, not enough
Take less, need stuff
Milked-out and made models
Built-up and broken bodies
Bawling then surprised
Falling then compliant
Technology is a war against time
Contra-chronology will never triumph
</code></pre>

<h3 id="Poems%20About%20Poets">Poems About Poets</h3>

<pre><code>Poetry is theft
Said the quoted quoter or
Was it the other

Alternative love
Song sold in the newspaper
Propose with purpose

Pull a Richard Hell
Quit school, move to NYC
Become a poet
</code></pre>

<h3 id="Terrified%20to%20Introspect">Terrified to Introspect</h3>

<pre><code>I see you&#39;re only slightly sightly
Wouldn&#39;t want to look too long
The horror&#39;s packed in lorries shipped and towed
Hung in hangers, planes lain in lines
Your worst fear realized: Oppie&#39;s a commie
Now tremble before the court and attempt to court me
Justify the dropping to crop the fighting yield
