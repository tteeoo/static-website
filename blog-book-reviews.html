<h1 id="Book%20Reviews">Book Reviews</h1>

<p>by Theo Henson — 2021-12-01</p>

<p>I plan on posting reviews of books I read that I find noteworthy.
In the mean time, here are my thoughts on a few I&#8217;ve finished recently.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;m going to be thinking about writing reviews, I should have more to say about future books;
mind the brevity of these.</p>

<p>Rated out of 5 stars.</p>

<h4 id="%3Cem%3ENeuromancer%3C/em%3E%20by%20William%20Gibson"><em>Neuromancer</em> by William Gibson</h4>

<p>A large influence in its corner of science fiction.</p>

<p>The book felt psychedelic—half the time you didn&#8217;t know exactly what was happening or why, but eventually you got the point.
I like that disoriented feeling if it&#8217;s done right (which I think it does), though another reader might not.
Quite frequently I encountered paragraphs that straddled a line between being superbly poetic or extremely cheesy—maybe they were both?</p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t much character development, but it didn&#8217;t matter to me. The expansive world-building more than made up for it (as is typical with sci-fi).</p>

<p>4.8 stars.</p>

<h4 id="%3Cem%3ESnow%20Crash%3C/em%3E%20by%20Neal%20Stephenson"><em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal Stephenson</h4>

<p>A logical progression from <em>Neuromancer</em> to get an idea of the cyberpunk genre.
While not entirely a parody work, it stretches themes and tropes in a humorous way.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t a literary masterpiece, but this was one of the most entertaining books I&#8217;ve read.
I recognize that entertainment is a highly subjective metric, and its value will probably change upon rereading, but how else should you rate a book?
Classicism can only go so far—a story has to be practical; it has to be enjoyable.
<em>Snow Crash</em> was like a witty action movie—one that wasn&#8217;t so obvious.</p>

<p>4.9 stars.</p>

<h4 id="%3Cem%3ENineteen%20Eighty-Four%3C/em%3E%20by%20George%20Orwell"><em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> by George Orwell</h4>

<p>It is certainly not a story for &#8220;entertainment&#8221; (unlike <em>Snow Crash</em>), otherwise I&#8217;d consider it to be poorly structured.
This book is meant as an allegory, one that has clearly resonated with many people.</p>

<p>At first it seemed like it would be anti-socialist propaganda, but upon completion this was not the case (though it is anti-Soviet).
Interestingly, as with <em>Animal Farm</em>, the state is depicted as evil because it has strayed from its stated intentions, now made to sustain social and economic inequality.
Perhaps this in itself is a criticism of socialism—that a centralized power is easy to subvert—which I think is legitimate,
but what makes the setting dystopian is the extreme capitalist characteristics—not in the sense of laissez-faire, but hierarchy; the state has a monopoly.
Perhaps this interpretation is a bit off the mark, but I find it intriguing (Orwell did call himself a democratic socialist).</p>

<p>4.6 stars.</p>
