# A Superbowl of Fairly Irrelevant Competitors

by Theo Henson — 2022-02-14

```
The snow fell outside while I
Deliberated my indoor goals.
The television buzzed across
my room; it bothers me.
That vidio (visual radio) showed
The ballgame 56, 23 to 20 in LA.
I stood there for a minute and ate
The ceremonal cholesterol.
Always, their advertisements are
The new products: a meta-sale.
Teams like that blend together.
Goats and Tigers ran around
The screen if I cared to watch.
Too busy, I'm wasting time
Playing Time - Pink Floyd.
The fake dilema,
Constructed in my head,
Awaits.
I know not to not know,
learning, the endless curricula.
Is data or are?
The real questions, these are.
Modernist cinderblocks tower into oblivion
likeastreamofconsciousnesstoooptmistictofall.
Or to fail?
There aren't many options but to do what
There is.
¿Or hay?
Hey—I didn't know that.
