# Zuckerberg; or, The Modern Frankenstein

by Theo Henson — 2021-10-13

The boy was born in 1984 (the year that thing named after the apple was released, and coincidentally, the setting of a poignant novel) in a suburb of the Big City.
He afforded a lucky childhood in the typical way: excelling at the various academies he attended, instilling pride in his family.
Enamored with some of the normal things, he liked space movies, but also ancient literatures and languages.
Most of all, though, it was the computer that occupied his time.
He used it to build machines—machines that didn't have motors or wires, rather loops and logic: programs.
Programs that talked to each other, played games and music, all without needing physical parts replaced or repaired—they were beautiful machines.

Eventually, the boy lived up to the grandeur of his youth and was accepted to the University (the University where that president, and the other one, as well as the software guy had gone).
He made more programs there, just for fun. After all, it was what his classes were about.
These programs, though, dealt with people, and people used them too.
They were used enough that he started to take things seriously: he made a company.
In a way, this was a new machine, one built with people and money.
He wanted to use this machine to spread the joys of his programs past the gated grounds of the University;
he wanted the world to be improved, but didn't know if he was the one to do it.

The boy saw an opportunity, and so he took it. He left the University to build the Machine (the Machine was both a program and a company).
He got the money from the prospectors in the Valley who now looked not for gold, but for golden ideas.
The people came naturally because they liked the Machine. At this point it was very likable—it was charming, fun, even.
People who knew those people came to the Machine, their friends and family.
Word of it spread quickly: "a wonderful Machine full of things made by people you know," and the boy worked hard to meet this ideal.
He was very happy with what he accomplished.
He had lived up to and beyond the grandeur that even the University expected of him. He had become popular with the people and made a very comfortable living.
These were all things he was told he should want. Most importantly, however, he was happy that the programs he made outside of the Big City and in the University were now part of the world.

The Machine was marvelous, of course, but it could not be stopped (because now it was the sum of a program, a company, and hundreds of millions of people and even more dollars).
The boy went along with this, but really, the Machine went along, while he just followed.
He tried to make more programs, just for fun, but it swallowed them.
The Machine was seen as something else by many people: with him, and came to the Machine to expand their power.
