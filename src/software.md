# Software

I encourage the use and development of free and open-source software.

## Used By Me

### Operating system: [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/)

A derivative GNU/Linux distribution of Arch Linux but without systemd.
I don't dislike systemd, I just decided to try something different.

### Text editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

Neovim is great for writing code and prose. It is essentially a more extensible fork of Vim.

### Graphical environment: [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)

A minimal (less than 2000 lines of C) [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) for X11.

## Written By Me

In my spare time I like to write software. I think programming is a great hobby.
It's like building machines, except you don't need to deal with the unreliable
and expensive nature of physical materials. Below are some featured projects of mine.

Most of it can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/tteeoo), and some on my [personal Git server](https://git.theohenson.com).
In the future I will likely post some of things I have made on this website.
