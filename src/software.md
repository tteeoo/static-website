# Software

## Used By Me

I like to use simple, [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) software.
Here is some I use which I find particularly agreeable.

### Operating system: [Debian](https://debian.org/)

The Universal operating system.
Perhaps the most prolific and flexible GNU/Linux distribution.

### Text editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

Neovim is great for writing both code and prose.
It is essentially a more extensible and polished fork of Vim.

### Graphical environment: [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)

A minimal (less than 2000 lines of C) [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) for X11.

## Written By Me

In my spare time I like to write software. I think programming is a great hobby.
It's like building machines, except you don't need to deal with the unreliable
and expensive nature of physical materials.

Most of my software can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/tteeoo), and some on my [personal Git server](https://git.theohenson.com).
In the future I will likely post some of the things I have made on this website.
