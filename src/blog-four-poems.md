# Four Poems

by Theo Henson — 2022-02-14

### Objective Order

```
All of 'em always offered an advice:
Avoid alliteration.
Soliloquy:
"Something's simply serendipitous:
Sliding same-sounding syllables!"
Where to begin:
Why talk boringly?
Wasting tongues bickering which type's better?
—What? Totally benign.
Colloquy:
"Can't you feel the urge to repeat?"
"Correct. Yippee! Freeing, this yearning 'tis ripe."
As it stands, all is smooth.
Flowing thoughts, frighteningly thick.
How humorously have hindered we by them!
Grammar grotesquely gambits greatness.
—Whoa be this!
Moral of the story:
Make often things strangely.
```

### A Superbowl of Fairly Irrelevant Competitors

```
The snow fell outside while I
Deliberated my indoor goals.
The tell-a-vision buzzed across
My room; it bothers me.
That vidio (visual radio) showed
The ballgame 56, 23 to 20 in LA.
I stood there for a minute and ate
The ceremonial cholesterol.
Always, their advertisements are
The new products: a meta-sale.
Teams like that blend together.
Goats and Tigers ran around
The screen if I cared to watch.
Too busy, I'm wasting time
Playing Time - Pink Floyd.
The fake dilemma,
Constructed in my head,
Awaits.
I know not to not know,
Learning, the endless curricula.
Is data or are?
The real questions, these are.
Modernist cinder blocks tower into oblivion
likeastreamofconsciousnesstoooptmistictofall.
Or to fail?
There aren't many options but to do what
There is.
¿Or hay?
Hey, I didn't know that.
```

### Why Would You Want to Live in the Dust?

```
A floor plan knows no one,
For it plots where feet go.
Doors open/close to hallways marching to and fro.
Some tiles up against the wall,
Build buildings three by three.
They never make anything/everything for free.
An architect draws her line,
Diagonal, angled as the pines' pear.
Freestanding structures jump/fall into the air.
The Desert is a place I've been,
Rather drab and full of sand.
Armies mold/place bricks by hand.
A few towns left me wondering:
Giza, Las Vegas, Dubai.
Why/how do/don't they even/ever try?
An ancient, religious, far-gone gambling desire,
Old oil's money hire people to make them.
Big ones store business/agitprop, a fake gem.
Once thought of as a parking lot,
They're going to need parking, lots.
Since 'twas accidentally a city,
And it doesn't look very pretty.
```

### Pax Americana

```
What's past can't change, can it?
The winner wins the right to write.
They set the writ to teach what's taught.
Come, sit, listen to the pedagogy.
Never any demagoguery; autodidact's evil.
Vines of vile grip the books compiled.
A historical dictatorial makes and breaks time.
Lime tastes sour and so does past salt.
"Halt!" The soldier screamed across the hall.
Fame's lame said they, now look.
Buy the new addition every year.
I know, it's much too much to justify each tear.
Sé, demasiado, peel back the ugly avocado.
Denim jeans thieves churn butter cream.
Cowboy, how boy, do you do it?—Move it?
Millions run up and down town allies.
Pallies, ally? Gal, shall I? Man, damn it!
Apples break grim secrets; quietly cry it.
It's silent, wouldn't you say?
Decir, ir, or stop? Fear makes the cleaner mop.

Grope the luxury on your stroll.
Think of the bugs you see headed for the hole.
Bowl, no water, don't tread on her.
March the fine line, not astray.
Think of all the games we win this way.
Don't think, just play 'til the
Time stop,
Ball drop,
Brain rot.
New year? Who cares? Go until the special pen.
It judges jewels not finely carved.
Writes "Diamond?—That's hard."
Name tags stickered on the surface.
Pen writes the wrongs long undone for fun.
Purpose: grimace, learn this, menace.
A no-frills quill bills you obsolete.
How does it feel, freak?
A dejected projector gestates your lecture.
Heard this, you learned pig?
Wear a wig, looks better.

The goal's reached, stopwatch at two o'clock.
Glock cocked, unblock it. 
Bigger war, bigger world, you heard?
Read the history on thee; Pax Americana.
Beam the thoughts into the rind of your melon mind.
Cantaloupe or Honeydew? Either way I'll get through.
In you I see a body for freely turning.
Work the machine until the crank breaks, and
Believe you're forced to bet your stake, yearning
Is a commercial pilot:
"I wish just once to fly over that next island."
Do the math, flight path won't allow it.
No gas to pass too far, you'll blast.
Smithereens, pieces unseen, no one's looking.
You're a crook in my book, read it here.
Robbers get no attention, Hood.
Run back to the woods across the brook.
They need you there if you're not square.
Beware the dogs but remember this:
Peace waits for hogs so please be brisk.
