### *The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect* by Roger Williams

by Theo Henson — 2022-1-

This is an interesting book, to say the least.
It was originally published online, free to download, although you can buy a printed-on-demand version (which I did, and would recommend).
The fact that it's a short, self-published sci-fi novel written by someone technically-minded really shows; it's eccentric and disturbing—cult classic material.

The main premise is something that others have—and still do theorize about: the technological singularity.
This singularity is a point when, due to the accelerating progress of technology, the state of humanity becomes permanentaly changed.
Most often, as in *The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect*, this point is crossed by some form of artificial intelligence (the titular "Prime Intellect").
The result is an unrecognizable reality, not explicitly good or bad, but an interesting setting to explore—and the characters sure do "explore" it.

More on that exploration: there are depictions of extreme, and gory, sex and violence. These scenes do end up relavent to the plot, although they feel a bit awkward. A good benchmark might be to read the first chapter, and see if you're still interested.

I thought that the ending was satisfying, as it poses what at least seems to be the main question that the author wants you to think about.
You get the sense that the author once thought (or still does, partially) that technological progress is a sort of desirable existential objective,
but in the face of a dissatisfying, inevitable singularity, he asks: what's the point?
