# On Global Government

by Theo Henson — 2021-11-11

### What is a nation? Why do they exist? What is their purpose?

The difficulty of these questions is thus: the responses given will change based on the nation asked.
One is quick to realize that they do not have easy, direct answers.

Historically, nations have started as small agricultural communities, perhaps forming alliances to increase their influence.
These communities occasionally developed into larger empires like those of Rome or Britain.
In the past couple of thousand years the growth of these empires has been curtailed by social change and technological limitations:
Rome lacked the ability to effectively communicate, and was therefore unable to operate the large swathes of land it controlled;
Britain fractured when its colonies eventually yearned for independence.
In modern times (the past few hundred years), a new kind of nation has cemented itself:
the nation-state, where within a well-defined boundary you can find Nationish people who speak the Nationish language and share a Nationish culture.

So what's next? How will—or should—the most important way people are organized (their nation) evolve?
The answer is global; the change from a community, to an empire, to a state, to a united, world government is a natural progression.
As technology progresses, new types of government become possible.
The current way most countries work would not be possible without modern, instant communication—Rome could not exist before bronze,
Britain not before boats. The potential for a global government may not yet exist, but eventually it will, society permitting.

### Why unify

A fully globalized government—provided that it is established in a just manner and proceeds to act accordingly—would be the most desirable.
People would be granted the same, liberal rights no matter where they geographically happen to have been born.

Now, one might ask something along the lines of: "historical empires were much larger than modern states,
so why would global unification be next—not just a possible step that could have been taken centuries ago?"
While it may be true that these empires controlled large amounts of land, containing many nations, the world is actually much more united today.
Thinking beyond the essentially arbitrary borders of land, the Internet, for example, allows people to instantly communicate and collaborate,
regardless of their nation. Obviously, legal unification will happen over a long time-scale, but we're currently close than ever.

### The structure of such a government
